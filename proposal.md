## Description
The end game of completing a series of Exploratory Data Analyses (EDAs) is to use what I find to inform my lines of inquiry when I contribute to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19): https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge, a challenge requiring more than a week's worth of time IMO. I hope to glean insight from analyzing datasets from South Korea, Italy, and the United States, and then carry those insights with me into the Open Research Challenge.

## ü•áObjective #1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on South Korea
* <i>Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset</i>
* <b>Why?</b>: By making tests readily available, South Korea successfully brought down the number of new cases each day (though officials are watchful for a resurgence, as there are still new clusters emerging). South Korea is a country that has clearly done something right, so I want to take a look at its data.
* <b>To demonstrate completion</b>, I will link to the GitHub commit in the tracker.

## ü•àObjective #2: EDA on Italy
* <i>Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-italy</i>
* <b>Why?</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic has reached crisis levels in Italy, which has the world's second-oldest population. The Italian doctors and nurses fighting on the front lines of this infection are pleading with the rest of the world to take this issue seriously. I am trying to, by analyzing their data!

## ü•âObjective #3: EDA on the USA
* <i>Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa#us_states_covid19_daily.csv</i>
* <b>Why?</b>: America's present situation can be attributed to, among other factors: limited testing; strangled access to that testing; substandard medical infrastructure, in terms of its ability to meet the needs of its population without becoming overwhelmed; and misaligned political incentives. As an American, I'm quite personally invested in how the situation pans out stateside.

## üî•Stretch goals (_optional_)
1. Parlay findings from EDAs into text mining and other machine learning efforts for CORD-19.
1. User-interactive website to display data in a visual, easily digestible way.
